When you're writing a getter for an ArrayList/other object, is it better to return a clone?

This is a great question and observation.

Strictly speaking if we want to preserve the encapsulation
of the object that contains the ArrayList/other object, we should
return a clone so that the instance variable cannot be changed directly by
some other object.  We call this making defensive copies.

Should pH and temperature even be stored in Stream? Just use Pool's instead?
If we assume that the stream emptying from the Pool is short enough that probably makes
sense.  if however a Stream could ever have 2 or more sources, or if a Stream is long
enough for its pH or temp to change, then we might want to assign its own.
